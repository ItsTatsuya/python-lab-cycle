'''Write a program to read a string containing numbers separated by a
space and convert it as a list of integers. Perform the following
operations on it.
1. Rotate elements in a list by 'k' position to the right
2. Convert the list into a tuple using list comprehension
3. Remove all duplicates from the tuple and convert them
into a list again.
4. Create another list by putting the results of the evaluation
of the function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥
2 – 𝑥 with each element in the
final list
5. After sorting them individually, merge the two lists to
create a single sorted list.'''
